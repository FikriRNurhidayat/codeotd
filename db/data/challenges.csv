bf4fcd54-4971-4c37-995d-051d4c525fd1,String: Palindrome,Find out whether a string is palindrome.,"#Objective

In this test, we create a function that accept a string, and validate whether it's palindrome or not, which returns boolean value.

# Function Description

Complete the `isPalindrome` function in the editor.

`isPalindrome` has the following parameters:

- `string str`: a string, might be word or just bunch of characters

# Returns

- `boolean`: the answer of whether the string is palindrome or not.

# Input Format

Input is basically just `stdin`, which each input will be seperated by line `\n`.

# Constraints

- `str` is alphanumeric that might contain space, comma, dot, semi colon, colon, and quot.
- Space, comma, dot, semi colon, colon, and quot are not considered as words, hence it can be ignored during the check.
- Check is case insensitive
- If the string length is odd, then the middle character will be ignored

# Sample Input 0

```
Katak
```

# Sample Output 0

```
true
```

# Explanation 0

Given `str = ""Katak""`, we see that first character is `K` and the last character is `k`.
And if we go inward, it will always have the same character, except the `t` character,
it does not have pair, and we ignore it from check."
